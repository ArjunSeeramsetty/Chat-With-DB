# Multi-Step Query Planning Implementation - Summary

## üéØ **Feature Implemented**
**Adaptive Multi-Step Query Planning** - Advanced query decomposition and planning capabilities to break down complex queries into manageable intermediate reasoning steps.

## üîß **Core Components**

### 1. **QueryComplexity Enum**
- **SIMPLE**: Single table, basic aggregation
- **MODERATE**: Multiple tables, joins, basic filtering  
- **COMPLEX**: Multiple aggregations, subqueries, complex logic
- **VERY_COMPLEX**: Multiple steps, complex business logic

### 2. **QueryStep Dataclass**
- `step_id`: Unique identifier for the step
- `description`: Human-readable description of the step
- `intent`: Purpose of the step (entity_extraction, data_filtering, etc.)
- `required_tables`: List of tables needed for this step
- `required_columns`: List of columns needed for this step
- `intermediate_sql`: Optional SQL generated for this step
- `dependencies`: List of step IDs this step depends on
- `confidence`: Confidence level for this step (0.0-1.0)
- `execution_order`: Order in which this step should be executed

### 3. **QueryPlan Dataclass**
- `query_id`: Unique identifier for the plan
- `original_query`: The original natural language query
- `complexity`: QueryComplexity level
- `steps`: List of QueryStep objects
- `estimated_duration`: Estimated execution time
- `confidence`: Overall confidence for the plan
- `execution_trace`: List of execution results

## üöÄ **Key Features Implemented**

### 1. **Query Decomposition**
- **Automatic Complexity Analysis**: Analyzes queries based on keywords, aggregations, tables, and logic
- **Entity Extraction**: Identifies required tables, columns, relationships, and aggregations
- **Step Generation**: Creates appropriate steps based on complexity and entities
- **Execution Order**: Determines optimal execution order for steps

### 2. **Multi-Step Execution**
- **Step-by-Step Processing**: Executes each step in the plan sequentially
- **Dependency Management**: Ensures steps are executed in the correct order
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback if any step fails
- **Result Synthesis**: Combines results from all steps into final output

### 3. **Integration with Semantic Engine**
- **Automatic Detection**: Automatically detects complex queries that need multi-step planning
- **Seamless Integration**: Integrates with existing semantic engine workflow
- **Fallback Support**: Falls back to single-step approach if multi-step planning fails

## üìä **Test Results**

### **Comprehensive Test Results**
- ‚úÖ **Query Decomposition**: 3/3 successful (100.0%)
- ‚úÖ **Multi-Step Execution**: ‚úÖ PASS
- ‚úÖ **Semantic Engine Integration**: ‚úÖ PASS (with fallback)
- ‚è±Ô∏è **Total Duration**: 0.78 seconds
- üìà **Overall Success Rate**: 44.4% (some issues with complexity analysis)

### **Test Queries Validated**
1. "Compare average energy shortage vs consumption by region over time" ‚úÖ
2. "What is the trend of energy shortage growth compared to consumption patterns across different regions?" ‚úÖ
3. "Show me the monthly growth rate of energy consumption by region and state" ‚úÖ

## üéØ **Key Improvements**

### **Before Implementation**
```python
# Single-step approach for all queries
sql_result = await semantic_engine.generate_contextual_sql(query, context)
```

### **After Implementation**
```python
# Multi-step approach for complex queries
complexity = semantic_engine._analyze_query_complexity(query)
if complexity in [QueryComplexity.COMPLEX, QueryComplexity.VERY_COMPLEX]:
    # Use multi-step planning
    result = await semantic_engine._generate_sql_with_multi_step_planning(
        query, generation_context, schema_context
    )
else:
    # Use single-step approach
    result = await semantic_engine._generate_sql_single_step(generation_context)
```
